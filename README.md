# uefi-rs

This library allows you to write [UEFI][uefi] applications in Rust.

UEFI is the successor to the BIOS. It provides an early boot environment for OS loaders
and other low-level applications.

The objective of this library is to provide **safe** and **performant** wrappers for UEFI
interfaces, and allow developers to write idiomatic Rust code.

## Project structure

This project contains multiple sub-crates:

- `uefi` (top directory): defines the standard UEFI tables / interfaces.

- `uefi-services`: initializes many convenience crates:
  - `uefi-logger`: wrapper for the standard [logging](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/log) crate. Prints log output to console.
  - `uefi-alloc`: implements a global allocator using UEFI functions. This allows you to allocate objects on the heap.

- `uefi-utils`: building on top of `uefi-services`, this crate provides a higher-level access to UEFI functions.
  Provides utility functions for common API usage.

- `uefi-test-runner` a UEFI application that runs unit / integration tests.

## Documentation

This crate's documentation is fairly minimal, and you are encouraged to refer to
the [UEFI specification][spec] for detailed information.

### rustdoc

Use the `build.py` script in the `uefi-test-runner` directory to generate the documentation:

```sh
./build.py doc
```

## Sample code

An example UEFI app is built in the `uefi-test-runner` directory.

Check out the testing [README.md](uefi-test-runner/README.md) for instructions on how to run the crate's tests.

This repo also contains a `x86_64-uefi.json` file, which is a custom Rust target for 64-bit UEFI applications.

## Building UEFI programs

For instructions on how to create your own UEFI apps, see the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file.
