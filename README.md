# uefi-rs

This library allows you to write [UEFI][uefi] applications in Rust.

UEFI is the successor to the BIOS. It provides an early boot environment for OS loaders
and other low-level applications.

The objective of this library is to provide **safe** and **performant** wrappers for UEFI
interfaces, and allow developers to write idiomatic Rust code.

## Crates

This project contains multiple sub-crates:

- `uefi` (top directory): contains wrappers around the UEFI interfaces.

- `uefi-services`: initializes many convenience crates:
  - `uefi-logger`: wrapper for the standard [logging](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/log) crate.
  - `uefi-alloc`: wrapper for the memory allocation functions. This allows you to allocate objects on the heap.

- `uefi-utils`: building on top of `uefi-services`, this crate provides a higher-level access to UEFI functions.
  Provides utility functions for common API usage.

- `uefi-test-runner` a UEFI application that runs unit / integration tests.

- `examples`: example UEFI apps.

- `tests`: unit and integration tests.

## Documentation

This crate's documentation is fairly minimal, and you are encouraged to refer to
the [UEFI specification][spec] for detailed information.

[spec]: http://www.uefi.org/specifications

### rustdoc

Use the `build.py` script in the `uefi-test-runner` directory to generate the documentation:

```sh
./build.py doc
```

### Sample code

Some example UEFI apps are in the `examples` directory.

The unit / integration tests are in the `tests` directory.

This repo also contains a `x86_64-uefi.json` file, which is a custom Rust target for 64-bit UEFI applications.

## Building UEFI programs

### Prerequisites

- [Xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo): this is essential if you plan to do any sort of cross-platform / bare-bones Rust programming.
- [LLD](https://lld.llvm.org/): this linker is now [shipped](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48125) with the latest nightly!

### Steps

The following steps allow you to build a simple UEFI app.

- Create a new `#![no_std]` binary, add `#![no_main]` to use a custom entry point,
  and make sure you have an entry point function which matches the one below:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn uefi_start(handle: Handle, system_table: &'static table::SystemTable) -> Status;
```

- Copy the `tests/x86_64-uefi.json` target file to your project's root.
  You can customize it.

- Build using `xargo build --target x86_64-uefi`.

- The `target` directory will contain a `x86_64-uefi` subdirectory,
  where you will find the `uefi_app.efi` file - a normal UEFI executable.

You can use the `tests` directory as sample code for building a simple UEFI app.
