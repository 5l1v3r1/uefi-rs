# uefi-rs
This library allows you to write [UEFI][uefi] applications in Rust.

UEFI is the successor to the BIOS. It provides an early boot environment for OS loaders
and other low-level applications.

The objective of this library is to provide **safe** and **performant** wrappers for UEFI
interfaces, and allow developers to write idiomatic Rust code.

## Documentation
This crate's documentation is fairly minimal, and you are encouraged to refer to
the [UEFI specification][spec] for detailed information.

You can find some example code in the `tests` directory,
as well as use the `build.py` script to generate the documentation.

This repo also contains a `x86_64-uefi.json` file, which is
a custom Rust target for 64-bit UEFI applications.

## Building UEFI programs
### Prerequisites
- [Xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo): this is essential if you plan to do any sort of cross-platform / bare-bones Rust programming.
- [LLD](https://lld.llvm.org/): the LLVM linker is currently the only supported linker.
  Alternatively, you can use `link.exe` if you are on Windows.

### Steps
The following steps allow you to build a simple UEFI app.
- Create a new `#![no_std]` crate, and make sure you have an entry point function which matches the one below:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn entry_point(handle: Handle, system_table: &'static table::SystemTable) -> Status;
```
- Copy the `tests/x86_64-uefi.json` target file to your project's root. You can create your own target file based on it.
- Build using `xargo build --target x86_64-uefi`.
- The generated static library needs to be linked with LLD, e.g.
```sh
lld-link /Machine:x64 /Subsystem:EFI_Application /Entry:entry_point uefi_app.lib /Out:uefi_app.efi
```
- You can run the `uefi_app.efi` file as a normal UEFI executable.

You can use the `tests` directory as sample code for building a simple UEFI app.
