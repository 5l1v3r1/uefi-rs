## Running the tests

### Prerequisites
Besides all the requirements for building a UEFI app, you will also need:

- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/): the most recent version of QEMU is recommended.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org): at least version 3.6 is required.
- [OVMF](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/OVMF):
  You need to extract `OVMF_CODE.fd` and `OVMF_VARS.fd` to the same directory as the `build.py` file.
  Alternatively, install OVMF using your distro's package manager and change the paths in the script file.

### Steps

It's as simple as running the `build.py` script with the `build` and `run` arguments:

```sh
./build.py build run
```

You can also pass `doc` for generating documentation, or `clippy` to run Clippy.
