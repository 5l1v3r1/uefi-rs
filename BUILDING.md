# Creating UEFI applications

UEFI applications are simple COFF (Windows) executables, with the special `EFI_Application` subsystem,
and some limitations (such as no dynamic linking).

The `x86_64-uefi.json` file creates a custom target for building UEFI / Windows apps, and links them using LLD.

## Prerequisites

- [Xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo): this is essential if you plan to do any sort of cross-platform / bare-bones Rust programming.
- [LLD](https://lld.llvm.org/): this linker is now [shipped](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48125) with the latest nightly!

## Steps

The following steps allow you to build a simple UEFI app.

- Create a new `#![no_std]` binary, add `#![no_main]` to use a custom entry point,
  and make sure you have an entry point function which matches the one below:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn uefi_start(handle: Handle, system_table: &'static table::SystemTable) -> Status;
```

- Copy the `tests/x86_64-uefi.json` target file to your project's root.
  You can customize it.

- Build using `xargo build --target x86_64-uefi`.

- The `target` directory will contain a `x86_64-uefi` subdirectory,
  where you will find the `uefi_app.efi` file - a normal UEFI executable.

You can use the `uefi-test-runner` directory as sample code for building a simple UEFI app.
